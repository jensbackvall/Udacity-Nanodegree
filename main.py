				['lesson-II-iv', 'Structuring your HTML', """I've already mentioned <b>Inline</b> and <b>block</b> tags, where block tags create an <em>invisible box</em> around their content.
				<br>
				These boxes are the basic framework of a web site and in the HTML document you can define these boxes with the <b>&lt;div&gt;</b> tag.
				<br>
				The web site is basically a series of boxes nested inside boxes, nested inside other boxes etc. In the HTML document this can seen as a <em>tree-like</em> structure of &lt;div&gt;s nested inside &lt;div&gt;s, nested inside &lt;div&gt;s etc.
				<br>
				<br>
				Important: <span class="specialfont-2">Although all boxes are SQUARE, their content can be ANY SHAPE!</span> So everything is square even when nothing is.
				<br>
				<br>
				But all the boxes aren't just &lt;div&gt;s. There can be paragraphs: <b>&lt;p&gt;</b>, tables: <b>&lt;table&gt;</b> and many other tags within the tree.
				<br>
				<br>
				This tree of tags is refered to as the <b>DOM</b> tree, or <span class="specialfont-1">D</span>ocument <span class="specialfont-1">O</span>bject <span class="specialfont-1">M</span>odel tree.
				<br>
				<br>
				When looking at HTML code, you can see the indented structure of the tags, inside tags, inside tags, which is where the term tree comes from, as these look somewhat like an inverted tree, starting with the outer branches to the far left and the bottom of the trunk at the far right. But unlike a tree, the trunk does not control the branches. In the case of HTML, if a tag is nested inside another tag (therefore being further to the right in the HTML document), it is controlled by the tag it is nested inside.
				<br>
				This is refered to as <b><em>inheritance</em></b>. The inherited properties can be controlled with the CSS code.

				<br>
				<br>
				With CSS, you can decide how big the aforementioned <em>invisible</em> boxes are, where they appear on the screen, what shape they are or contain, what colour, border or margin they have, what colour, size, font or other styling text has etc. They are loads of things you can control with the CSS.
				<br>
				<br>
				The great thing about having these things separated from the HTML, is that you can let a single snippet of code in CSS control many big pieces of code in the HTML. This let's you minimize the amount of code you need to accomplish many similar things in many different places on a web site.
				<br>
				<br>
				You do this by giving the
				<b>class</b> name to all HTML elements that you want to give the same look, and asigning the specific class different styles in the CSS file.
				<br>
				I did this with the bold, blue letters in <span class="specialfont-1">C</span>ascading <span class="specialfont-1">S</span>tyle <span class="specialfont-1">S</span>heets, using a class that I've named <em>specialfont-1</em>.

In addition to this, it makes it easier for you to change general aspects of your sites appearance in an easy way, without having to rewrite almost everything from scratch.
				<br>
				This is done by making sure that all the <em>invisible</em> boxes in your HTML are divided into &lt;div&gt;s that are assigned specific <b>class</b> names.
				<br>
				<br>
				When I wrote the code for this page, I started by creating all the containers or &lt;div&gt;s for everything for every element on the page, like <span class="specialfont-3">Lesson1</span>, <span class="specialfont-3">Lesson2</span> and <span class="specialfont-3">Lesson3</span>, with different parts, like <span class="specialfont-3">The Web</span>, <span class="specialfont-3">Online Resources</span> or <span class="specialfont-3">CSS</span> nested inside them.
				<br>
				I did this without putting any content inside them, other than a little place-holder text.Once I had created the entire HTML structure or tree, I started writing the CSS for the different classes and parts of the page.
				After this I put my notes and any other content I wanted to add inside the &lt;div&gt;s.
				<br>
				While filling in the content, I saw where I wanted special text or other styling and created things like the class <em>specialfont-1</em> that I mentioned earlier, to make the text more interesting and readable.
				<br>
				<br>
				This made it possible for me to avoid unnecessary repetition in the code, because the structure was, and is, so easy to read. An important thing when coding. I can now change the look of the page easily, by just changing a few things in the CSS.
				<br>
				<br>
